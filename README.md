#orthogroup.sh

This script assumes that you have installed OrthoFinder and loaded the appropriate module. It also assumes that you have a directory path/to/NLR_protein_sequences containing your NLR protein sequences in FASTA format, and a directory path/to/orthogroups to store the output.

The script first creates the output directory if it doesn't already exist. It then runs OrthoFinder with the following options:

    -f: specifies the input directory containing the protein sequences.
    -t: specifies the number of threads to use.
    -S: specifies the sequence similarity search tool to use. In this case, we use Diamond.
    -A: specifies the multiple sequence alignment tool to use. In this case, we use MAFFT.
    -M: specifies the method to use for building the phylogenetic tree. In this case, we use FastTree.
    -o: specifies the output directory.

After OrthoFinder finishes running, the script extracts the orthogroup families from the Orthogroups.txt file produced by OrthoFinder. It does this using a series of awk and sed commands to reformat the file into a FASTA file containing one sequence per orthogroup. The resulting file is saved as orthogroups.fasta in the output directory.

Note that this script assumes that the protein sequences are named in a consistent manner across all genotypes, and that the directory containing the sequences contains only the protein sequences for the
